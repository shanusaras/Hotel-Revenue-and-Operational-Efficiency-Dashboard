## Project Objective
The primary objective is to support Atliq Grands' revenue management team by providing insights from historical data, enabling data-driven strategies for optimizing bookings, enhancing occupancy, and maximizing revenue.

## Data Sources and Tools
- **Data**: Historical booking data from Atliq Grands.
- **Tools & Languages**: Power BI( for visualization), DAX (for KPI calculation), Excel, and SQL for data manipulation.

## Business Problem
Due to increased competition and outdated management decisions, Atliq Grands has experienced a drop in market share and revenue. This project aims to:
- Identify high-impact areas to target specific customer segments and improve occupancy.
- Detect patterns of cancellations and booking trends.
- Create data-driven recommendations for revenue recovery.

## Methodology
1. **Data Cleaning and Transformation**: Prepared and cleaned data to ensure accuracy, removed duplicates, and transformed data for in-depth analysis.
2. **Analytical Techniques**:
   - Segmented analysis in four areas: Overall Analysis, Revenue Analysis, Booking Analysis, and Rating Analysis.
   - KPI calculations using DAX for dynamic insights on key metrics.

## Key Insights and Recommendations
- **Elite Customer Focus**: Prioritize targeting high-value customers across cities, especially for RT2 room types, as they significantly boost revenue.
- **Revenue Trends**: Observed a 28.17% revenue decline in the last week of the month, with Mumbai contributing 13.59% of the total revenue.
- **Cancellations**: June recorded a high cancellation rate of 25.09%, negatively impacting occupancy rates.
- **Room Type Optimization**: Focus on RT2 room types as they are strongly correlated with revenue growth.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
Primary KPIs calculated using DAX:
- Total Bookings
- Total Revenue
- Average Rating
- Occupancy %
- Cancellation Rate
- Average Daily Rate (ADR)
- RevPAR (Revenue per Available Room)

### Supporting Metrics
Additional metrics for nuanced analysis:
- Total Capacity
- Total Successful Bookings
- Total Cancelled Bookings
- Revenue Loss
- Daily Sellable Room Nights (DSRN)
- Revenue Week-on-Week Change %
- ADR Week-on-Week Change %
- DSRN Week-on-Week Change %

## Next Steps
1. **Seasonal Trend Analysis**: Incorporate forecasting for high and low seasons.
2. **Competitor Analysis**: Add pricing and occupancy trends from competitors to guide dynamic pricing.
3. **Customer Retention Strategies**: Implement initiatives for customer loyalty and retention.
